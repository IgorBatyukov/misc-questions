## Explain the concept of a hash table in Python. How does it relate to dictionaries?

In Python, dictionaries are implemented as a hash table. When we add key, value pair to the dictionary, Python applies 
a hash function to the key to compute the index of the stored value. That being said, the keys of the Python 
dictionaries must be of immutable data type. Whenever the hash function underneath the Python dictionary is to produce 
a collision, when we get the same result for the different arguments to that function, Python uses probing method to 
resolve such collisions.

So, the has tables are the foundation of dictionaries in Python that provides us with O(1) access to the values using 
the keys.
