## What is the purpose of the __init__ method in Python classes? How does it differ from __new__?

`__new__` is responsible for the actual class' object creation and allocation it in memory, 
while `__init__` is responsible for the class instance and it's attributes initialization.

In Python REPL we can write a simple class example and create it's instance to demonstrate order of methods calls.
Generally, there is no reason for overriding `__new__` method as it will be inherited from the abstract `object` class.
```python
class Example:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("__new__ method called")
        return super().__new__(cls) 
        # this cls returned here will be used as a value to the argument `self` in the `__init__` method 
    
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
        print("__init__ method called")

        
>>> example_class_instance = Example(1)
__new__ method called
__init__ method called
```

It can be useful in Singleton pattern where we need to make sure that the only one instance of the class is created.
```python
class SingletonExample:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            print("__new__ method called")
        return cls._instance
    
    
>>> singleton_instance_1 = SingletonExample()
__new__ method called
>>> singleton_instance_2 = SingletonExample()
# __new__ method wasn't called here as we use already created instance
```

One of the example of Singleton pattern is the database connection where we make sure 
that the only one connection object is used to interact with the database, preventing unnecessary resource usage.

```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    _instance = None
    _connection = None

    def __new__(cls, db_name):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._connection = cls._connect(db_name)
        print(f"using active connection [{cls._connection}]")
        return cls._instance
    
    @classmethod
    def _connect(cls, db_name):
        print(f"connected to {db_name}")
        return f"{db_name} connection"

    
>>> db1 = DatabaseConnection("postgres-instance-1")
connected to postgres-instance-1
using active connection [postgres-instance-1 connection]

# we are not connecting to the DB again later
>>> db1 = DatabaseConnection("postgres-instance-1")
using active connection [postgres-instance-1 connection]

>>> db2 = DatabaseConnection("postgres-instance-2") 
using active connection [postgres-instance-1 connection]
