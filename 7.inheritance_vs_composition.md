## Explain the difference between inheritance and composition in Python. Provide an example of each.

### Inheritance
The mechanism where a new class, which is the child or subclass, is created based on parent class. 
In the result we have tightly coupled classes with "is-a" relationship. That mean that the subclass is a more 
specialized version of its parent.

Code is reusable in this case since child classes can use the methods of the parent class. Useful when there is 
clear hierarchical relationship between classes in the system. However, due to tight coupling, tests may be challenging,
especially when that hierarchy of classes is quite complex.

### Simple example
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Device(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def print_message(self):
        pass


class Printer(Device):
    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label

    def print_message(self):
        print("The message from the printer")


class Fax(Device):
    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label

    def print_message(self):
        print("The message from the fax")


>>> my_printer = Printer("HP")
>>> my_fax = Fax("Fax No.1")

>>> my_printer.print_message()
The message from the printer

>>> my_fax.print_message()
The message from the fax

```

### Composition
This mechanism represents the combination of objects, where class can contain instances of another classes instead 
of inherited behaviour. This creates a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains or "has" instances of another class.

The objects are not so tight couples an sn in the example with inheritance. Therefore, composition allows for more 
flexible designs as objects can be composed and recomposed from different parts. Tests are more easier to maintain and
perform since changes made in one object doesn't necessarily affect another object.

```python
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, horsepower):
        self.horsepower = horsepower

    def start(self):
        print(f"Engine with {self.horsepower} HP started.")


class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, horsepower):
        self.brand = brand
        self.engine = Engine(horsepower)

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()
        print(f"Car {self.brand} is ready to go")


>>> car = Car("Audi", 500)
>>> car.start()
Engine with 500 HP started.
Car Audi is ready to go
```
