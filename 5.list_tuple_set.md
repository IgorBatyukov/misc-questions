## Explain the trade-offs between using a list, tuple, and set in Python. Provide scenarios where each data structure is most suitable.

### List
Mutable, ordered collection of items. Can contain objects of various types with no restriction to duplicates.

Useful when we need to keep an order of the collection or to modify the collection itself. Items can be added, removed, 
re-order in lists.

```python
>>> my_list = ["item_1", "Item_2", 1, 2, None]
>>> my_list[1]
'Item_2'

>>> my_list[1:3]
['Item_2', 1]

>>> my_list.append(25)
>>> my_list
['item_1', 'Item_2', 1, 2, None, 25]

>>> my_list.remove(25)
['item_1', 'Item_2', 1, 2, None]
```

### Tuple
Quite similar to lists with that difference that it's immutable collection. 
Can contain objects of various types with no restriction to duplicates

Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists due to their immutable nature, but less flexible since we can't modify them.
Since immutable, tuple is hashable and can be used as a dictionary key.

As an example, a collection of week days.
```python
days = (
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
    "Sunday",
)

>>> days[0]
'Monday'

population_dict = {
    ("New York", "USA"): 8.4,
    ("Tokyo", "Japan"): 14.0
}

>>> population_dict[("New York", "USA")]
8.4
```

### Set
Mutable, unordered collection. The key point is that set keeps only unique items and the items themselves must of an 
immutable type.

Useful when we need to store unique elements and fast memberships tests are required. 
```python
>>> unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}
>>> unique_numbers.add(5)
unique_numbers
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

>>> unique_numbers.remove(2)
>>> unique_numbers
{1, 3, 4, 5}
```
### Comparison table for most common operations
| **Operation**             | **List**         | **Tuple**        | **Set**  |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Indexing** (get item)    | O(1)             | O(1)             | N/A      |
| **Access by value**        | O(n)             | O(n)             | O(1)     |
| **Appending**              | O(1) (amortized) | N/A (immutable)  | O(1)     |
| **Inserting at beginning** | O(n)             | N/A (immutable)  | N/A      |
| **Inserting in middle**    | O(n)             | N/A (immutable)  | N/A      |
| **Updating an element**    | O(1)             | N/A (immutable)  | N/A      |
| **Removing an element**    | O(n)             | N/A (immutable)  | O(1)     |
| **Membership test (`in`)** | O(n)             | O(n)             | O(1)     |
