## What is Dependency Injection and what are its advantages or disadvantages?

The method/pattern to manage dependencies between classes. Compared to the previous example with Composition pattern, 
we'd provide dependencies to the object from the outside rather than allowing this object to create them. 

```python
class Database:
    def fetch_user(self, user_id):
        return {"id": user_id, "name": "John Doe"}

    
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, db: Database):
        self.db = db # db object is passed from the outside

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.db.fetch_user(user_id)

database = Database()
user_service = UserService(database)

```

### Advantages
- loose coupling between objects
- easier to test as we can just to mock dependency

### Disadvantages
- not suitable for the small projects as it there might be a simpler approaches 
- at the same time, in very large projects it maybe challenging to track the flow of dependencies across the application
- not common pattern in Python
- not too many well-established standalone DI frameworks in Python
