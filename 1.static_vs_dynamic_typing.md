## Explain the difference between static typing and dynamic typing
In static typing, the type of a variable is known at compile time and cannot change, 
as seen in languages like C++ or Java. In contrast, dynamic typing allows a variable's 
type to change at runtime, as in Python or JavaScript, where types are checked during execution. 
Static typing generally catches type errors earlier, while dynamic typing offers more flexibility.

Static typing languages are faster during compilation time and more suitable for large projects as the typing 
errors less likely to happen. In such projects is easier for developers to track types of the variable.
Dynamic typing languages more suitable small to average size projects.

Python is a good example of the dynamic typing

### Python example. Dynamic typing, variables types can be changed easily with no errors.
```python
x = "dynamic typing example"

>>> print(type(x))
<class 'str'>

x = 1 
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'int'>
```
### C++ example. Static typing where type is bind to the variable.
```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;  // x is of type int
    std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl;
    
    x = "dynamic typing example";  // Error: invalid conversion from ‘const char*’ to ‘int’
    
    return 0;
}

>>> error: invalid conversion from ‘const char*’ to ‘int’

```
