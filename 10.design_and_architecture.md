### What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?
Monolith application is built as a single, unified unit. All components of the application are tightly coupled 
and combined in single codebase. The application is typically running as a single process. Difficult to scale specific 
parts of the application independently. Changes in one part of the application can affect the whole system. A failure 
in one part of the application can bring down the entire system.

On contrast, the microservices-based application is a combination of independent services that communicate with 
each other. Typically, each service is responsible for some business logic. Each service is scalable, maintainable and 
changes in one of them not necessarily affect the other services. However, microservices can be mode complex since 
coordination between them is required, also more challenging in terms of integration tests.  

### How do you handle errors in a distributed system?
Isolating the 'erroring' part, investigating the route cause of the problem, returning it back to action. Centralized 
and meaningful logging system can be of a great help here.  

### What is the purpose of a load balancer in a system?
The primary role of the load balancer is the distribution of the incoming traffic between the services. In this way, 
the load can be distributed between less loaded and healthy services allowing multiple requests to be executed in 
parallel. 

### What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?
The main difference is that in the synchronous type of communication both sender and receiver are engaged in 
communication and the latter expects to get an immediate response. For example, http request - client sends 
request and waits for the response.
On the other hand, in the async communication sender sends the request and doesn't wait for the immediate response. The
response maybe delayed and sent once available. In the meantime, sender can operate on another tasks instead of waiting
for the response in blocking manner. 

### What is the difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling?
In vertical scaling the machine or server will get more resources like RAM or CPU, while horizontal scaling will be 
expanding the amount of machines / nodes in the system.

### What is the purpose of a content delivery network (CDN)?
The main purpose is to reduce delay between user's requests for some content and time of that content delivery to the
user. This is achieved by storing cached version of the content in geographically distributed servers and delivering 
content from the closest one to the user.

### How do you handle data consistency in a distributed system?
By combination of systems allowing replication and partitioning of the data.

### What is the difference between data replication and data partitioning?
In replication approach the data is copied and stored on different nodes making each copy is highly available, while 
portioning or sharding ensures that the data is divided into smaller parts (partitions) and distributed across nodes. 
This allows us to increase read / write performance and scaling ability.
