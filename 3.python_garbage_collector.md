## How does Python's garbage collection mechanism work?

There are two techniques in Python garbage collection system: Reference Counting and Cyclic Garbage Collection.

### Reference Counting, which is primary mechanism 
Every object in Python has reference count to track the number of references to that object. 
As soon as the value of that counter set to zero, the memory occupied by the object is freed. 
It's fast and efficient. The main disadvantage is circular reference when two or more objects have references to each 
other. Therefore they won't be garbage collected with reference counting. 

```python
x = "Hello world" # Reference count set to 1 for the string object
y = x # Reference count incremented

del x # Reference count set back to 1
del y # Reference count set to 0, the object will be garbage collected
```

### Cyclic Garbage Collection
Python divides objects into three separate groups/generations based on their lifetime. The main idea is that most 
of the objects don't live long and can be collected early. Those object that weren't collected through multiple GC 
iterations are moved to the older groups. The garbage collector periodically checks these groups then. If a cycle 
reference is found and none of the objects are accessible from the program itself, they will be marked for garbage 
collection.


In both cases garbage collection is a fully autonomous process. However, there is a built-in library `gc` that provides
some control over this mechanism.
