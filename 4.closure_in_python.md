## Explain the concept of a closure in Python. Provide an example of how it can be used.

When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function can access the variables of the outer function. 
If the outer function returns the inner function, the inner function (closure) retains access to the outer function's 
variables, even after the outer function has finished execution.

Some usage examples include a function factory, when we can created a new function based on the arguments passed to the 
outer function or decorators, when we modify behavior of the function passed as an argument to the outer function.


### Function Factory example 
```python
def multiplier(multiply_by):
    def inner(x):
        return x * multiply_by
    return inner


>>> times_5 = multiplier(5) # the `times_5` function will be multiplying the argument by 5 every time
>>> times_5(10)
50
>>> times_5(5)
25
```

### Decorator example. A simple decorator that tracks the function execution time and prints it.
```python
import time


def fn_timer(fn):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
        stop = time.time()
        time_delta = stop - start
        print(f"Function {fn.__name__} executed for {time_delta} sec")
        return result
    return wrapper


@fn_timer
def test_fn():
    time.sleep(4)
    return True


>>> test_fn()
Function test_fn executed for 4.000486135482788 sec
True
```
